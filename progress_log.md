# Progress log - Freelance coding journey

## Day 1

Built script that logs my name + timestamp to the console and a file. Pushed to GitHub

## Day 2

Built scipt that gets users name, stores it in a file with the timestamp and then displays this to the console

## Day 3

Built script that stores list of products, price and stock. Prints report of the above and the average price of all items

## Day 4

Built a script using API call, can handle non-200 responses. If 200 is received, info is printed in json format

## Day 5

Built a script that loads a JSON file, both locally and from an API call, then merges these into a single variable and pretty prints them. Added handling for local file not found and API call failing

## Day 6

Built a script that utilises the CLI argparse. Been inconsistent because of real life training, that's no problem.:)

## Day 7

Refactor files and folders

## --- Week 2 ---

## Day 8

Created a script that scrapes a webpage title:

-   wrapped in function
-   handles websites that timeout
-   handles non-200 status codes
-   handles webpages with no title tag
-   removes tags from title and return

## Day 9

Done the same day as day 8

Modified the script to allow for use of find_all, refactored code to have the request in a function of its own

-   gets all elements of specified tag
-   removes all tags that do not contain text
-   strips whitespace
-   returns new list containing only stripped tags that contain text

## Day 10

Added some pagination

-   doesn't work the best, but gets the job done
-   can't be bothered to elaborate (basically chatgpt helped a lot lol.)
-   i don't like pagination
