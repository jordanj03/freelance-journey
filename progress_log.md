# Progress log - Freelance coding journey

## Day 1

Built script that logs my name + timestamp to the console and a file. Pushed to GitHub

## Day 2

Built scipt that gets users name, stores it in a file with the timestamp and then displays this to the console

## Day 3

Built script that stores list of products, price and stock. Prints report of the above and the average price of all items

## Day 4

Built a script using API call, can handle non-200 responses. If 200 is received, info is printed in json format

## Day 5

Built a script that loads a JSON file, both locally and from an API call, then merges these into a single variable and pretty prints them. Added handling for local file not found and API call failing

## Day 6

Built a script that utilises the CLI argparse. Been inconsistent because of real life training, that's no problem.:)
