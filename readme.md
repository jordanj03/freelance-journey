This is a 60-day project designed to elevate my skills to the point where I can start considering freelancing. I believe that following the project to its conclusion will put me in this position.

I am approaching this from a perspective of curiosity and amibition.

My biggest challenge will likely (most definitely) be consistency, that is why each day will have me creating a mini-script to keep me motivated and moving forward.

## week 1

Completing the first week took longer than one week. This is fine. The timeline may be off but we keep moving forward

I learned:

-   The basics of interacting with files (opening, closing, reading, writing)
-   Input output basics, how to take input from the user and handle this
-   How to use lists and dictionaries, at a basic level
-   The basics of API requests, how to handle non-200 repsonses and retrieve JSON information
-   JSON handling, getting from an API request and file, converting to and from dictionary, merging.
-   How to build a CLI that utilises argparse to allow for commandline arguments
